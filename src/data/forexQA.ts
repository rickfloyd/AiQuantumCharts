        question: "What is a currency pair?",
        answer: "A currency pair is the quotation of two different currencies, with the value of one currency being quoted against the other. The first listed currency of a currency pair is called the base currency, and the second currency is called the quote currency. For example, in EUR/USD, EUR is the base currency and USD is the quote currency.",
        keywords: ["currency pair", "pair", "base", "quote"],
    },
    {
        question: "What does the base currency represent in a forex pair?",
        answer: "The base currency is the first currency in a forex pair. It represents how much of the quote currency is needed for you to get one unit of the base currency. For example, if the EUR/USD price is 1.10, it means 1 Euro (the base currency) is worth 1.10 US Dollars.",
        keywords: ["base currency", "pair", "represent"],
    },
    {
        question: "What does the quote currency represent?",
        answer: "The quote currency is the second currency in a forex pair. It is the currency in which the price of the base currency is expressed. In the pair GBP/JPY, the Japanese Yen is the quote currency.",

    },
    {
        question: "What is a pip and how is it calculated?",
        answer: "A 'pip' stands for 'percentage in point' or 'price interest point.' It is the smallest price move that a given exchange rate can make. For most currency pairs, one pip is equivalent to 0.0001. For pairs involving the Japanese Yen (JPY), a pip is 0.01. It's calculated by observing the change in the fourth decimal place (or second for JPY pairs).",

    },
    {
        question: "What is a lot size in forex trading?",
        answer: "A lot size is a unit of measurement that standardizes the size of a trade. The value of a trade is determined by the lot size, and changes in pip value are proportional to the lot size being traded.",
        keywords: ["lot size", "trade size", "unit"],
    },
    {
        question: "What are micro, mini, and standard lots?",
        answer: "These are different lot sizes: A standard lot is 100,000 units of the base currency. A mini lot is 10,000 units. A micro lot is 1,000 units. Some brokers also offer nano lots, which are 100 units.",

    {
        question: "What is leverage and how does it affect your trades?",
        answer: "Leverage is the use of borrowed funds from a broker to increase the size of a trading position beyond what would be possible from your own capital. For example, with 100:1 leverage, you can control a $100,000 position with just $1,000. It magnifies both potential profits and potential losses.",

    {
        question: "What is margin and why is it required?",
        answer: "Margin is the amount of money required in your account to open and maintain a leveraged position. It is not a fee, but a portion of your account equity set aside as a good-faith deposit. It's required by brokers to cover any potential losses you might incur.",
        keywords: ["margin", "deposit", "collateral", "leveraged position"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a margin call?",
        answer: "A margin call occurs when the equity in a trader's account falls below the required margin level. The broker will demand that the trader deposits additional funds or closes losing positions to bring the equity back up to the required level. If the trader fails to do so, the broker may automatically close positions.",

        question: "What is the difference between spot forex and futures forex?",
        answer: "Spot forex involves the physical exchange of a currency pair, taking place 'on the spot' at the current market rate. Forex futures are contracts to buy or sell a specific amount of a currency at a set price on a future date. Spot forex is traded OTC, while futures are traded on centralized exchanges.",

    {
        question: "What is liquidity and why does it matter in forex?",
        answer: "Liquidity refers to the ability to buy or sell a currency pair without causing a significant change in its exchange rate. High liquidity means there are many buyers and sellers, which typically results in tighter spreads and smoother execution of trades. The forex market is the most liquid market in the world.",
        keywords: ["liquidity", "spreads", "execution", "buy sell"],
    },
    {
        question: "What are major, minor, and exotic currency pairs?",
        answer: "Major pairs are the most traded pairs and all involve the US Dollar (e.g., EUR/USD, USD/JPY). Minor pairs (or cross-currency pairs) do not involve the USD but feature other major currencies (e.g., EUR/GBP, AUD/JPY). Exotic pairs consist of one major currency paired with the currency of an emerging economy (e.g., USD/TRY, EUR/SGD).",

    // 2. Spreads, Fees & Order Types
    {
        question: "What is the spread in forex trading?",
        answer: "The spread is the difference between the bid (sell) price and the ask (buy) price of a currency pair. This is the primary cost of trading and how most brokers make their money.",
        keywords: ["spread", "bid", "ask", "cost", "fees"],
    },
    {
        question: "How is the spread calculated?",
        answer: "The spread is calculated by subtracting the bid price from the ask price. For example, if the EUR/USD bid price is 1.1050 and the ask price is 1.1052, the spread is 2 pips.",
        keywords: ["spread calculation", "bid", "ask", "pips"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between a fixed and variable spread?",
        answer: "A fixed spread stays the same regardless of market conditions, offered by dealing desk brokers. A variable spread constantly changes, reflecting the market's supply and demand, and is offered by non-dealing desk brokers. Variable spreads are typically lower but can widen significantly during news events.",
        keywords: ["fixed spread", "variable spread", "dealing desk", "non-dealing desk"],
    },
    {
        question: "How do brokers make money from spreads?",
        answer: "Brokers buy a currency at the bid price and sell it to traders at a slightly higher ask price. The difference, the spread, is their profit. They process thousands of these transactions, and the small profit from each spread adds up.",
        keywords: ["broker profit", "spread", "bid", "ask"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a commission-based trading account?",
        answer: "A commission-based account (often called an ECN or Raw Spread account) offers very tight, sometimes zero, spreads. Instead of profiting from the spread, the broker charges a fixed commission per trade (e.g., $3.50 per lot traded).",
        keywords: ["commission", "ecn account", "raw spread", "fees"],
    },
    {
        question: "What factors influence the size of the spread?",
        answer: "The main factors are market liquidity and volatility. Highly liquid pairs (like EUR/USD) have tighter spreads. During high volatility or low liquidity (like news events or after-hours), spreads tend to widen.",
        keywords: ["spread factors", "liquidity", "volatility", "news"],
    },
    {
        question: "Why do spreads widen during news events?",
        answer: "During major news releases, market uncertainty increases, and liquidity can dry up as major players pull back. To compensate for the increased risk and fewer participants, liquidity providers widen their spreads.",
        keywords: ["spread widen", "news events", "risk", "liquidity"],
    },
    {
        question: "How can spreads affect your profitability?",
        answer: "A wider spread means a higher transaction cost. For a trade to become profitable, the price must first move enough to cover the spread. For frequent traders or scalpers, high spreads can significantly erode profits.",
        keywords: ["spread profitability", "transaction cost", "scalping"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is slippage and when does it occur?",
        answer: "Slippage is the difference between the expected execution price of an order and the price at which it is actually executed. It often occurs during high volatility (like news events) when prices are moving rapidly, or when placing large market orders.",
        keywords: ["slippage", "execution price", "volatility"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a stop order?",
        answer: "A stop order (or stop-loss) is an order to buy or sell a security when its price moves past a particular point, ensuring a particular price. It is used to limit losses or lock in profits. A buy-stop is placed above the market price, and a sell-stop is placed below.",
        keywords: ["stop order", "stop-loss", "risk management"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a limit order?",
        answer: "A limit order is an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better. A buy-limit order is placed below the current market price, and a sell-limit order is placed above it. It guarantees the price but not the execution.",
        keywords: ["limit order", "entry order", "price control"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a market order?",
        answer: "A market order is an order to buy or sell a security immediately at the best available current price. It guarantees execution but not the price, which can be a risk during volatile periods (leading to slippage).",
        keywords: ["market order", "immediate execution", "slippage"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a trailing stop and how is it used?",
        answer: "A trailing stop is a type of stop-loss order that is set at a percentage or dollar amount away from the current market price. As the market price moves in a favorable direction, the trailing stop moves with it, locking in profits while still giving the trade room to grow. If the price reverses, the stop triggers.",
        keywords: ["trailing stop", "profit lock", "dynamic stop"],
    },
    {
        question: "What does bid-ask spread tell you about market conditions?",
        answer: "A tight bid-ask spread indicates high liquidity and stable conditions, meaning there are many buyers and sellers. A wide spread suggests lower liquidity or high volatility, indicating more uncertainty or risk in the market.",

    },

    // 3. Support & Resistance
    {
        question: "What is support in forex trading?",
        answer: "Support is a price level where a downtrend can be expected to pause due to a concentration of demand or buying interest. As the price drops towards support, it is more likely to 'bounce' off this level rather than break through it.",
        keywords: ["support", "price level", "floor", "demand"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is resistance in forex trading?",
        answer: "Resistance is a price level where an uptrend can be expected to pause temporarily, due to a concentration of supply or selling interest. As the price rises towards resistance, it is more likely to be rejected from this level rather than breaking through it.",
        keywords: ["resistance", "price level", "ceiling", "supply"],
    },
    {
        question: "How can traders identify support and resistance levels?",
        answer: "Traders identify these levels by looking at historical price charts. Key methods include finding previous swing lows (for support) and swing highs (for resistance), using trendlines, moving averages, Fibonacci retracement levels, and psychological round numbers (e.g., 1.2000).",
        keywords: ["identify support", "identify resistance", "swing points", "trendlines", "moving averages"],
    },
    {
        question: "What happens when a support level is broken?",
        answer: "When a support level is decisively broken, it signals that sellers have overcome buyers. This often leads to a continuation of the downtrend, with the price potentially falling to the next support level. The broken support level can then become a new resistance level.",
        keywords: ["support broken", "breakdown", "continuation", "flip"],
    },
    {
        question: "What happens when a resistance level is broken?",
        answer: "When a resistance level is broken, it's known as a breakout. This signals that buyers have overcome sellers, and the price is likely to continue moving higher until it reaches the next resistance level. The broken resistance can become a new support level.",
        keywords: ["resistance broken", "breakout", "continuation", "flip"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a breakout and why is it significant?",
        answer: "A breakout is a price movement that pushes through a well-defined level of support or resistance. It is significant because it can signal the start of a new trend or the continuation of an existing one, often accompanied by increased volume.",
        keywords: ["breakout", "support break", "resistance break", "new trend"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a false breakout?",
        answer: "A false breakout (or 'fakeout') occurs when the price temporarily moves beyond a support or resistance level but then quickly reverses, failing to continue in the breakout direction. This can trap traders who entered on the initial break.",
        keywords: ["false breakout", "fakeout", "trap", "reversal"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a retest and how is it used in trading?",
        answer: "A retest happens after a breakout, when the price returns to the broken support or resistance level to 'test' it from the other side. A successful retest (e.g., price bounces off the old resistance, now acting as support) confirms the breakout and can provide a safer entry point for traders.",
        keywords: ["retest", "confirmation", "breakout strategy", "entry point"],
    },
    {
        question: "How do round numbers act as psychological support or resistance?",
        answer: "Round numbers (e.g., 1.3000, 100.00) often act as psychological levels where traders tend to place orders. Many large institutional orders and stop-losses are clustered around these figures, creating natural support or resistance zones.",
        keywords: ["round numbers", "psychological levels", "support", "resistance"],
    },
    {
        question: "What role do trendlines play in identifying support and resistance?",
        answer: "Trendlines are drawn to connect a series of swing lows in an uptrend or swing highs in a downtrend. In an uptrend, the trendline acts as a dynamic support level. In a downtrend, it acts as a dynamic resistance level.",
        keywords: ["trendlines", "dynamic support", "dynamic resistance", "diagonal"],
    },
    {
        question: "How do moving averages act as dynamic support and resistance?",
        answer: "Moving averages (like the 50 EMA or 200 SMA) can act as dynamic support and resistance levels. In a strong uptrend, price will often pull back to and bounce off a moving average. In a downtrend, it may rally to a moving average before falling again.",
        keywords: ["moving averages", "dynamic support", "dynamic resistance", "ema", "sma"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is the concept of “flipping levels” in support and resistance?",
        answer: "This is a core concept where a broken level changes its role. When a resistance level is broken, it often becomes a future support level. Conversely, when a support level is broken, it often becomes a future resistance level. This is also known as 'role reversal'.",
        keywords: ["flipping levels", "role reversal", "support becomes resistance", "resistance becomes support"],
    },
    {
        question: "How do volume levels confirm support and resistance zones?",
        answer: "High trading volume at a specific price level indicates strong interest, making that level more significant. A bounce from a support level accompanied by high buying volume provides stronger confirmation. A rejection from resistance with high selling volume does the same.",
        keywords: ["volume", "confirmation", "support", "resistance", "volume profile"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between horizontal and diagonal support/resistance?",
        answer: "Horizontal support and resistance are static price levels that are marked by a horizontal line across the chart (e.g., previous highs/lows). Diagonal support and resistance are dynamic and are represented by trendlines that follow the angle of the trend.",
        keywords: ["horizontal support", "horizontal resistance", "diagonal support", "diagonal resistance", "trendline"],
    },
    {
        question: "Why is support and resistance important for risk management?",
        answer: "Support and resistance levels are crucial for risk management because they provide logical places to set stop-loss orders. For example, a trader going long might place their stop-loss just below a support level. They also help in setting profit targets, as a trader might aim to take profit at the next resistance level.",
        keywords: ["support resistance risk", "risk management", "stop-loss", "profit target"],
    },

    // 4. Chart Patterns
    {
        question: "What are chart patterns in forex trading?",
        answer: "Chart patterns are formations that appear on a price chart that have a historical tendency to be followed by a particular price movement. Traders use them to identify potential trend continuations or reversals.",
        keywords: ["chart patterns", "formations", "technical analysis"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a double top pattern?",
        answer: "A double top is a bearish reversal pattern that forms after an extended uptrend. It consists of two consecutive peaks at roughly the same level, separated by a moderate trough. A break below the trough (the 'neckline') signals a potential trend reversal to the downside.",
        keywords: ["double top", "bearish reversal", "pattern", "peaks"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a double bottom pattern?",
        answer: "A double bottom is a bullish reversal pattern that forms after a downtrend. It consists of two consecutive troughs at roughly the same level, separated by a moderate peak. A break above the peak (the 'neckline') signals a potential trend reversal to the upside.",
        keywords: ["double bottom", "bullish reversal", "pattern", "troughs"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a head and shoulders pattern?",
        answer: "A head and shoulders is a bearish reversal pattern. It features three peaks: a central, higher peak (the 'head') flanked by two lower peaks (the 'shoulders'). A break of the 'neckline' connecting the lows of the two troughs signals a strong potential downtrend.",
        keywords: ["head and shoulders", "bearish reversal", "pattern", "neckline"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is an inverse head and shoulders pattern?",
        answer: "An inverse head and shoulders is a bullish reversal pattern. It has three troughs: a central, deeper trough (the 'head') flanked by two shallower troughs (the 'shoulders'). A break of the 'neckline' connecting the highs of the two peaks signals a strong potential uptrend.",
        keywords: ["inverse head and shoulders", "bullish reversal", "pattern", "neckline"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a wedge pattern and what does it indicate?",
        answer: "A wedge pattern is formed by two converging trendlines. A rising wedge (converging upwards) is typically a bearish reversal pattern. A falling wedge (converging downwards) is typically a bullish reversal pattern. They can also act as continuation patterns, but are more commonly seen as reversals.",
        keywords: ["wedge pattern", "rising wedge", "falling wedge", "reversal"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a triangle pattern in forex charts?",
        answer: "A triangle is a consolidation pattern created by converging trendlines. There are three main types: symmetrical, ascending, and descending. They generally indicate a temporary pause in the trend before a breakout.",
        keywords: ["triangle pattern", "symmetrical", "ascending", "descending", "consolidation"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a symmetrical triangle and how is it traded?",
        answer: "A symmetrical triangle has a descending upper trendline and an ascending lower trendline. It indicates indecision in the market. Traders typically wait for a breakout in either direction and then trade in the direction of the break, often with a target equal to the height of the triangle's base.",
        keywords: ["symmetrical triangle", "indecision", "breakout"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is an ascending triangle?",
        answer: "An ascending triangle is a bullish continuation pattern characterized by a flat upper trendline (resistance) and a rising lower trendline (support). It suggests that buyers are more aggressive than sellers, and it typically breaks out to the upside.",
        keywords: ["ascending triangle", "bullish continuation", "resistance"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a descending triangle?",
        answer: "A descending triangle is a bearish continuation pattern with a flat lower trendline (support) and a descending upper trendline (resistance). It indicates that sellers are more aggressive, and it usually breaks out to the downside.",

    },
    {
        question: "What is a flag pattern and how do you trade it?",
        answer: "A flag is a short-term continuation pattern. It consists of a strong price move (the 'pole') followed by a small, rectangular consolidation (the 'flag') that slopes against the trend. Traders look for a breakout from the flag in the direction of the original trend.",
        keywords: ["flag pattern", "continuation", "pole", "consolidation"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a pennant pattern?",
        answer: "A pennant is very similar to a flag. It's a short-term continuation pattern that follows a strong price move (the 'pole'), but the consolidation phase is a small symmetrical triangle (the 'pennant'). It also signals a likely continuation of the trend.",

    },
    {
        question: "What is a cup and handle pattern?",
        answer: "A cup and handle is a bullish continuation pattern. It looks like a 'U'-shaped cup followed by a short, downward-drifting handle (similar to a flag). A breakout above the handle's resistance signals a continuation of the prior uptrend.",

    },
    {
        question: "What is a rectangle consolidation pattern?",
        answer: "A rectangle (or range) is a pattern where price moves sideways between two horizontal support and resistance levels. It represents a period of indecision. Traders can either trade the range (buy at support, sell at resistance) or wait for a breakout in either direction.",

    },
    {
        question: "How do continuation patterns differ from reversal patterns?",
        answer: "Continuation patterns (like flags, pennants, and triangles) signal a temporary pause in an existing trend, suggesting the trend is likely to resume. Reversal patterns (like double tops/bottoms and head and shoulders) suggest that an existing trend is losing momentum and is likely to change direction.",

    {
        question: "What is the psychology behind chart patterns?",
        answer: "Chart patterns are visual representations of the supply and demand dynamics—the battle between buyers (bulls) and sellers (bears). For example, a double top shows that bulls tried to push the price higher twice but failed, indicating that selling pressure is taking over.",

    },
    {
        question: "How can volume confirm chart pattern breakouts?",
        answer: "Volume is a crucial confirmation tool. A genuine breakout should be accompanied by a significant increase in trading volume, which indicates strong conviction behind the move. A breakout on low volume is more likely to be a false breakout.",
        keywords: ["volume confirmation", "breakout", "conviction"],
    },
    {
        question: "What is a fakeout pattern and how do you avoid it?",
        answer: "A fakeout (or false breakout) is when price breaks a pattern's boundary but then reverses. To avoid them, traders often wait for additional confirmation, such as a candle closing beyond the level, a retest of the broken level, or a surge in volume.",
